1. Only two drugs, Ramicane and Capomulin demonstrate the ability to effectively shrink tumor volume over the course of the trial period, with Ramicane being only slightly more effective. Ketapril, on the other hand, might be actively increasing tumor volume size, as the mean tumor volumes at each timepoint with this particular drug are even greater than those receiving a placebo treatment.\
\
2. No drug demonstrates the ability to halt or decrease the spread of metastatic sites. All mice experienced an increase in metastatic sites over the course of the trial period, though those treats with Ramicane and Capomulin saw the smallest increase.\
\
3. Even though Ketapril saw/caused the greatest increase in tumor volume and one of the bigger increases in the spread of metastatic sites, it did not result in the greatest number of mouse deaths. That honor belongs to Propiva, particularly around day 30, which is also when it shows a sharp spike in the number of metastatic sites. }
