matplotlib homework assignment for data bootcamp

Holy moly! This one was tough. I feel like my code is a bit of a mess, so any feedback you have on streamlining would be really helpful. 

For each of the line charts, I looked at a couple of ways to randomly select a marker for each, and would have liked to set up some kind of iterable array or list of marker symbols and then include them in the formatting code somehow, but couldn't quite figure out how this would work. Again, any thoughts or hints or pointers on this would be helpful. 

On the last line chart for mouse survival rate - couldn't quite get my head around calculating standard error on this one. Either got one value for the whole DataFrame, or the same value for all mice/drugs. Glad I got something to plot, but not totally sure what the issue is.
