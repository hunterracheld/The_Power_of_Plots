This project looks at the complete data from a recent animal study by a fictitious pharmaceutical company. In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. The objective was to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

To do this, I:
  - Created a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
  - Created a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each   treatment.
  - Created a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
  - Created a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.



For each of the line charts, I looked at a couple of ways to randomly select a marker for each, and would have liked to set up some kind of iterable array or list of marker symbols and then include them in the formatting code somehow, but couldn't quite figure out how this would work. Again, any thoughts or hints or pointers on this would be helpful. 

On the last line chart for mouse survival rate - couldn't quite get my head around calculating standard error on this one. Either got one value for the whole DataFrame, or the same value for all mice/drugs. Glad I got something to plot, but not totally sure what the issue is.
